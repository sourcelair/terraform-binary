# Python wrapper for Terraform

This is a Python wrapper for Hashicorp's Terraform. Using `terraform-binary` you can install Terraform using Pipenv or Pip, instead of manually downloading, unzipping and installing it.

## Usage

```sh
pipenv install --dev terraform-binary

terraform init # Now you can use terraform, after you installed it with Pipenv or Pip.
```
